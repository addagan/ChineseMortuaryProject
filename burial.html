        <p> The differences between European-settler burial rituals and that of the Chinese largely contributed to the nativist belief
           that the Chinese were permanent sojourners, incapable of assimilation like other immigrants of Canada. These differences
           fed into the beliefs of the “anti-Oriental” movement that advocated for the deterrence of Chinese immigration. To better 
           understand Chinese funerary practices, it is important to understand the nature of competing religious ideologies at play 
           and the customs distinct to the regions this first wave of Chinese immigrants came from. </p>

        <h2>Chinese Death Philosophies</h2>
          </div> 
          </a>

<p>Chinese Canadians trace their customary traditions to ancient China rather than the contemporary iteration of the country, 
which was strife with political, social and economic upheaval. This meant that birth and death remained two extremely important events 
 in the life cycle of the Chinese. The competing philosophical and religious developments of Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism 
           contributed to the funerary practices and superstitions of the day. While Daoists were concerned with the forces of Nature,
           the Confucianists were devoted to preserving connections to the community and family and the Buddhists with the afterlife. 
           Descendants of the deceased ancestors were particularly conscious of the conditions of the dead, as punishment amongst the 
  living was believed to be a result of a failure to provide for the deceased.</p> 
 
<p>As Confucianist doctrines emphasized patriarchal authority in the acts of filial piety, the bachelor environment of the Chinese in 
           Canada was particularly efficacious in maintaining systems of ancestor reverence and the survival of ancient practices. 
           Daoist concerns for fengshui, translating literally to “wind and water”, or geomancy ensured that the orientation of graves 
           and cemeteries were of the utmost importance. The harmonious balance of the elements would confirm smooth departures for the 
           deceased relative, reflecting in the prosperity in the descendants life. Daoist principles further dictates that the living
           person has two souls the hun, or ethereal, masculine yang soul, and the po, the passive, feminine yin soul. This dualistic 
           vision of the living soul transforms into shen, which refers to the spirit that ascends to heaven, and gui, the spirit that
           returns to or remains on earth. These principles would later be incorporated into the Confucius reverence for ancestors, 
  modifying the very nature of Chinese Canadian burial rituals abroad.</p>

<p>Adoption of European-settler, frontier traditions became another contributing factor to variations in the funerary rituals of Chinese 
           Canadians, with a lack of uniformity in the preservation of beliefs and practices altering the traditions of those abroad.</p>

          <div style="text-align:center">
            <h2>Exhumation and Repatriation</h2>
          </div>

<p>Fraught with settler discrimination and poor working conditions, the reality of death was persistent in the minds of those Chinese
           living abroad. It thus became the role of the district and family associations to take care of burials, exhumations as 
           well as repatriation back to China. The main district association in charge of this funerary process in Victoria was the 
           Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA). The CCBA employed couriers who would collect burial remains from all
           across the country, clean the bones by running water and wrap the bones in a traditional manner to be stored in metal 
           crates in a brick building at Harling Point. Within seven years, largely to due to the high cost of the exhumation 
           procedures as well as shipment, the remains would be repatriated back to China to be buried at the home villages of the 
  deceased.</p> 

<p>Relocation of burial remains was especially beneficial to those concerned with relieving the guilt and burden involved with
           strict adherences to traditional funerary practices. Furthermore, the numerous seasonal observations surrounding
           the deceased could be avoided, especially when such customary obligations often contributed to heavy economic burdens
           on those trying to make a life for themselves in their new homeland. These observatory practices usually involved
           offers of food and liquor, the burning of paper money as well as incense. Annual observation ceremonies were obligatory
           during Qing Ming, Yulanpen or Hungry Ghosts festival, as well as during Chinese New Year. While these cultural practices 
           helped to alleviate the severed ties to home in a time when many in the Chinese community were met with vehement 
           discrimination, the general view amongst European-settlers in relation to the Chinese were concerns around 
  radical difference and heathen worship of the dead.</p>

<p>Although the repatriation of burial remains were thought to ensure the resting of the soul in one’s home village, many 
           deceased were forgotten, largely due to the passage of time. Furthermore, political events on the homeland drastically
           deterred or altogether discontinued the shipments of bones, two such events being the Sino-Japanese War of 1937– 1945, 
           and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. As the communist agenda sought to eradicate the superstitious 
           customs of a bygone world, the imperative for Chinese communities abroad to retain the cultural practices of their 
           ancestors became ever apparent.</p> 

           <div style="text-align:center">
             <h2>East vs. West</h2>
          </div>

<p>The level of regard for physical remains as opposed to the actual burial plots appear to be the main differences between European
           and Chinese burial practices and philosophies. As Judeo-Christian religion stressed confidence in the eternal afterlife,
           devotion to burial remains were discouraged, leaving the notion that graves should be permanent. European-settler 
           attitudes surrounding the foreign and unfamiliar practices of the Chinese community were clear. A <i>Victoria Daily Colonist</i> 
           article published December 11th of 1890 described the act of exhumation as “ghoulish work” in which the burial excavations
           “[gave] forth the most noisome odors and possibly charg[ed] the atmosphere with the germs of the most contagious diseases”. 
           As these sentiments were not rare amongst the white-settler community, an article from the same publication reports of a 
           government motion to order a health officer visit to the burying grounds to ascertain whether or not the practice of 
           “exhumation was against public health”. As discriminatory laws and practices became an intrinsic part of the Chinese 
           experience in Canada, the creation of a Chinese-only burial space became a necessity. After purchasing of what is now 
           called the Harling Point Cemetery, community members proceeded to enact a plan that would involve a mock funeral procession 
           to gauge the threat of racist backlash. In 1903, the CCBA performed a mock funeral procession which was supervised by a
           Victoria police officer. A man with a rifle approached by the parade in a violent fashion and was informed by the officer
           that the Chinese people had received permission to hold funeral ceremonies by the provincial government. This incident 
  was the first and last of its kind.</p>
